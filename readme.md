An unsupported copy of the dart2js compiler.

## Note - unsupported

This library had been used by the DartPad backend to compile Dart source code. We've since switched to invoking dart2js from the command-line - this package is now wholly unsupported; we don't intend to publish additional versions.

## About

This is a copy of the dart2js source available as a package. The API of this
package can and will change in unpredictable and incompatible ways.
